Objective: To predict atom replacements and uncover alloy behavior insights 
•Utilized Monte Carlo Methods for analyzing Al-Mg (5 atomic percent) bi-crystals derived from Al bi-crystals with CSL boundaries
 •Led comprehensive EDA, utilized PCA projection for efficient dimension reduction, and optimized training for achieving accurate results

 The Project is currently ongoing.
